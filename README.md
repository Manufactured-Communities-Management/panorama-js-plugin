Simplifies the use of Material UI in your React project.


## Description

This plugin adds utility classes to make it easier to build user interfaces with Material UI.

Think about things such as:

- numeric textfields (that automatically format the input as a number, without the constrictions that type="number" has)
- removable textfields (textfields that call a onRemove() callback when the user presses the backspace key while the textfield is empty)
- loading spinners (that maintain their rotation through state changes, including when the component is unmounted and remounted, or hidden/shown)
- etc.

This just makes it easier to build consistent and user-friendly interfaces.


## Final words

I hope this plugin will be useful to you. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to get in touch at [LowEntry.com](https://lowentry.com/).
